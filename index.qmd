Hi everyone! I am Jeanie, a CS student currently studying in Singapore Institute of Technology.
Here is my linkedin profile if you want to see more of what I've been up to: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeanie-chua/

I'm excited to share some of the projects I've been working on with you, and hope that you get a hit of inspiration while exploring my site.
Some of my hobbies include adventuring, playing team games and hosting events. 
I also volunteer occasionally with the Visible Circle, an initiative to support people with chronic pain.
I like being active! Classpass is my go-to but I do run, play tennis and recently picked up golf too!

Have a good day!
