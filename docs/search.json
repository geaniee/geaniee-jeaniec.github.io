Some of my hobbies include adventuring, playing team games and hosting events. I also volunteer occasionally with the Visible Circle, an initiative to support people with chronic pain. I like being active! Classpass is my go-to but I do run, play tennis and recently picked up golf too!\nHave a good day!\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"
